Just a colleciton of things which I find useful to have around. Feel free to borrow code from the files for your own use.

Resizing windows on OSX
-----------------------

If you have a laptop and you are frequently working both standalone and with a thunderbolt display, you are probably used to resizing your windows by hand. I finally got fed up with that, found some people were using applescript to do the resizing for them, and built some of my own.

* windows-config-mobile is the script I run to set my windows for standalone (1440x900) resolution;
* windows-config-work is the script for when I'm docked to a (somewhat large) thunderbolt. I typically keep my laptop open and combine its screen into one common space (per virtual desktop).

Vim config
----------

If you were curious how to configure something fancy in Vim -- well, the vimrc file in here probably won't help. I run with a fairly basic setup, primarily with MacVim running in its gvim form, so a lot of the cosmetic mappings I used to make on Windows are obsolete (and, thus, gone).
