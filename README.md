Resizing windows on OSX
-----------------------

If you have a laptop and you are frequently working both standalone and with a thunderbolt display, you are probably used to resizing your windows by hand. I finally got fed up with that, found some people were using applescript to do the resizing for them, and built some of my own.

* windows-config-mobile is the script I run to set my windows for standalone (1440x900) resolution;
* windows-config-work is the script for when I'm docked to a (somewhat large) thunderbolt. I typically keep my laptop open and combine its screen into one common space (per virtual desktop).
